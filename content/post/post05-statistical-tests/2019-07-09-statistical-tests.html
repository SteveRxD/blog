<p><em><a href="https://steverxd.github.io/Stat_tests/">This is a book</a> in which I demonstrate that most common statistical tests are special cases of simple linear models. This offers a simplified and intuitive way to teach and learn statistical tests. It builds on an open-source book written by Jonas Lindeløv.</em></p>

<p>The book <a href="https://lindeloev.github.io/tests-as-linear/">Common statistical tests are linear models (or: how to teach stats)</a>, by Jonas Lindeløv, beautifully demonstrates how many common statistical tests (such as the t-test, ANOVA and chi-squared) are special cases of a linear model. It also demonstrates that many non-parametric tests, which are needed when certain test assumptions do not hold, can be approximated by linear models using the <em>rank</em> of values.</p>
<p>To better understand this I wrote my own version of the book, <a href="https://steverxd.github.io/Stat_tests/">Common statistical tests are linear models (a work through)</a>, which builds on the original. The objective of this was to solidify my understanding of the book by reproducing the examples provided; by expanding on areas where there were gaps in my knowledge; and by paraphrasing some of the explanations, using concepts and terms with which I was more familiar.</p>
<p>The approach explained in the book offers a way to greatly simplify the teaching of introductory statistics, using the simple model of the form <em>y = a + b⋅x</em>, which is familiar to most students. This approach brings coherence to a wide range of statistical tests, which are usually taught to students as independent tools. The approach also helps to explain the intuition underlying statistical tests, drawing on the familiar concept of linear regressions, which emphasizes understanding over rote learning.</p>
<p>As well as solidifying my own understanding, I hope this book might be helpful to others following along with Lindeløv’s book, but who require more background on some of the concepts being discussed. The GitHub repository for my book can be found <a href="https://github.com/SteveRxD/Stat_tests">here</a>.</p>
