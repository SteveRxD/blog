<p><em>Intro.</em></p>
<!--more--->
<p>This is a reworking of the book Common statistical tests are linear models (or: how to teach stats), written by Jonas Lindeløv. The book beautifully demonstrates how many common statistical tests (such as the t-test, ANOVA and chi-squared) are special cases of the linear model. The book also demonstrates that many non-parametric tests, which are needed when certain test assumptions do not hold, can be approximated by linear models using the rank of values.</p>
<p>This approach offers a way to greatly simplify the teaching of introductory statistics, using the simple model of the form <span class="math inline">\(y = a + b⋅x\)</span>, which is familiar to most students. This approach brings coherence to a wide-range of statistical tests, which are usually taught to students as independent tools with a potentially-overwhelming array of names. The approach also helps to explain the intuition underlying statistical tests, drawing on the familiar concept of linear regressions, which emphasizes understanding over the rote learning.</p>
