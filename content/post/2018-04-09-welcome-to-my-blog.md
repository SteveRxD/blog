Welcome to my new blog. I'm using this as an opportunity to explore new data analysis and visualisation tools. This is intended as an exercise in learning-by-doing: as I learn new skills, I will be using these to explore data relating city, state and local issues.

<!--more-->
I will be focusing on my areas of interest, which include the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of local areas. I will also be looking at the way in which local public services are funded. This includes services that impact on people's everyday lives, from high-profile services such as schooling, social care and policing, to more prosaic issues such parking and waste collection.

My previous work has focused on UK government, but as a recent arrival to the United States I will be using the blog to learn more about how cities and states operate on this side of "the pond".  I hope you find it interesting.

__Technical stuff__  
Most of the analysis carried out in this blog will use the __R programming language__. As a former Microsoft Excel junkie, I'm increasingly relying on this powerful and flexible tool for my day-to-day data analysis work. For anyone getting started, I highly recommend the excellent and accessible (not to mention free!) [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund.

This website is itself written using R. Having learned the basics of R, including how to write R Markdown files (which allow you to seamlessly blend your code, output and prose commentary into a single document), you can publish these as webpages. This is done using the __Blogdown__ package for R. Technical instructions are provided in [blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), but beginners such as myself might prefer to start with step-by-step guides provided in other blogs, such as [here](http://jonthegeek.com/2018/02/27/blogging-in-ten-minutes/) and [here](http://mcdussault.rbind.io/post/building-your-blog-using-blogdown/).
