<p>Welcome to my new blog. I’m using this as an opportunity to explore new data analysis and visualization tools. This is intended as an exercise in learning-by-doing: as I learn new tools, I will be using these to explore real-life data sets.</p>
<p>Most of the analysis carried out in this blog will use the <strong>R programming language</strong>. As a former Microsoft Excel junkie, I’m increasingly relying on this powerful and flexible tool for my day-to-day data analysis work. For anyone getting started, I highly recommend the excellent and accessible <a href="http://r4ds.had.co.nz/">R for Data Science</a> by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund.</p>
<p>This website is itself written using R. Having learned the basics of R, including how to write R Markdown files (which allow you to seamlessly blend your code, output and commentary into a single document), you can publish these as webpages. This is done using the <strong>Blogdown</strong> package for R. Technical instructions are provided in <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown</a>, but beginners such as myself might prefer to start with step-by-step guides provided in other blogs, such as <a href="http://jonthegeek.com/2018/02/27/blogging-in-ten-minutes/">here</a> and <a href="http://mcdussault.rbind.io/post/building-your-blog-using-blogdown/">here</a>.</p>
