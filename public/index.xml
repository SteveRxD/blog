      <title>Common statistical tests are linear models</title>

      <description>The book Common statistical tests are linear models (or: how to teach stats), by Jonas Lindeløv, beautifully demonstrates how many common statistical tests (such as the t-test, ANOVA and chi-squared) are special cases of the linear model. It also demonstrates that many non-parametric tests, which are needed when certain test assumptions do not hold, can be approximated by linear models using the rank of values.
To better understand this I wrote my own version of the book, Common statistical tests are linear models (a work through), which builds on the original.</description>

      <title>Comparing city spending with Tableau</title>

      <description>I learned the basics of Tableau a few years ago, and have been impressed with its ability to produce interactive visualizations and share them online.
One feature I wanted to explore further was the ability for users to ‘drill down’ into the results presented in a dashboard. This avoids overwhelming the user with too much data up front, while still giving them the freedom to explore the data in more detail should they choose.</description>

      <title>A neighborhood crime map using Shiny</title>

      <description>Shiny has been on my list of things to learn for quite a while now. With it you can make interactive web apps straight from R.
With this in mind, I built a simple app that accesses crime data from the City of Dallas and maps the locations in my neighborhood. The app can be found here. This accesses the latest data from the City of Dallas’ OpenData API which is updated daily.</description>

      <description>As a new arrival in Dallas, it’s taken me a while to get to grips with its layout. Its sheer size and sprawl make it difficult to identify where Dallas ends and neighboring cities begin.
With this in mind, this post had two aims: to better understand the geography of Dallas, and to explore some of the GIS tools available in R, the open-source programming language.</description>

      <title>Funding cuts and deprivation in England</title>

      <description>The most deprived parts of England have borne the brunt of public spending cuts since 2010. As spending now begins to increase, this could bring relief to some of the hardest-hit local councils. However, this analysis shows that the gains - unlike the cuts - will be shared fairly evenly among both affluent and deprived parts of England.
In 2010 the UK government embarked on a series of major spending cuts to reduce its budget deficit, in response to the financial crisis.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my new blog. I’m using this as an opportunity to explore new data analysis and visualization tools. This is intended as an exercise in learning-by-doing: as I learn new tools, I will be using these to explore real-life data sets.
Most of the analysis carried out in this blog will use the R programming language. As a former Microsoft Excel junkie, I’m increasingly relying on this powerful and flexible tool for my day-to-day data analysis work.</description>
