      <description>Shiny has been on my list of things to learn for quite a while now. With it you can make interactive web apps straight from R.
With this in mind, I built a simple app that accesses crime data from the City of Dallas and maps the locations in my neighborhood. The app can be found here. This accesses the latest data from the City of Dallas’ OpenData API which is updated daily.</description>

      <description>As a new arrival in Dallas, it’s taken me a while to get to grips with its layout. Its sheer size and sprawl make it difficult to identify where Dallas ends and neighboring cities begin.
With this in mind, this post had two aims: to better understand the geography of Dallas, and to explore some of the GIS tools available in R, the open-source programming language.</description>

      <title>Funding cuts and deprivation in England</title>

      <description>The most deprived parts of England have borne the brunt of public spending cuts since 2010. As spending now begins to increase, this could bring relief to some of the hardest-hit local councils. However, this analysis shows that the gains - unlike the cuts - will be shared fairly evenly among both affluent and deprived parts of England.
In 2010 the UK government embarked on a series of major spending cuts to reduce its budget deficit, in response to the financial crisis.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my new blog. I’m using this as an opportunity to explore new data analysis and visualization tools. This is intended as an exercise in learning-by-doing: as I learn new tools, I will be using these to explore real-life data sets.
Most of the analysis carried out in this blog will use the R programming language. As a former Microsoft Excel junkie, I’m increasingly relying on this powerful and flexible tool for my day-to-day data analysis work.</description>
