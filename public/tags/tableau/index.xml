      <description>In this post I create a Tableau dashboard that compares how US cities raise and spend money, using data from the Fiscally Standardized Cities (FiSCs) database.
I learned the basics of Tableau a few years ago, and have been impressed with its ability to produce interactive visualizations and share them online.
One feature I wanted to explore further was the ability for users to ‘drill down’ into the results presented in a dashboard.</description>
