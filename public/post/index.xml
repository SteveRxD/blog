      <description>As a new arrival in Dallas, itâ€™s taken me a while to get to grips with its layout. Its sheer size and sprawl make it difficult to identify where Dallas ends and neighboring cities begin. Expanses of new developments and construction appear to have blurred the lines between what were once distinct towns and cities.
With this in mind, this post has two aims: first, to better understand the geography of Dallas, and second, to do so while exploring some of the GIS tools available in R, the open-source programming language.</description>

      <description>The most deprived parts of England have borne the brunt of public spending cuts since 2010.

In 2010 the UK government embarked on a series of major spending cuts to reduce its budget deficit, in response to the financial crisis.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my new blog. I&amp;rsquo;m using this as an opportunity to explore new data analysis and visualization tools. This is intended as an exercise in learning-by-doing: as I learn new tools, I will be using these to explore data relating to city, state and local issues.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
