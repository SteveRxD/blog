      <title>Common statistical tests are linear models</title>

      <description>This is a book in which I demonstrate that most common statistical tests are special cases of simple linear models. It builds on an open-source book written by Jonas Lindeløv. This offers a simplified and intuitive way to teach and learn statistical tests.
The book Common statistical tests are linear models (or: how to teach stats), by Jonas Lindeløv, beautifully demonstrates how many common statistical tests (such as the t-test, ANOVA and chi-squared) are special cases of a linear model.</description>

      <title>Comparing city spending with Tableau</title>

      <description>In this post I create a Tableau dashboard that compares how US cities raise and spend money, using data from the Fiscally Standardized Cities (FiSCs) database.
I learned the basics of Tableau a few years ago, and have been impressed with its ability to produce interactive visualizations and share them online.
One feature I wanted to explore further was the ability for users to ‘drill down’ into the results presented in a dashboard.</description>

      <title>A neighborhood crime map using Shiny</title>

      <description>In this post I created a crime map of my local neighborhood, using live data accessed from the City of Dallas’ OpenData portal.
Shiny has been on my list of things to learn for quite a while now. With it you can make interactive web apps straight from R.
With this in mind, I built a simple app that accesses crime data from the City of Dallas and maps the locations in my neighborhood.</description>

      <title>A dot-density map of Dallas</title>

      <description>As a new arrival in Dallas, it’s taken me a while to get to grips with its layout. Its sheer size and sprawl make it difficult to identify where Dallas ends and neighboring cities begin.
With this in mind, this post had two aims: to better understand the geography of Dallas, and to explore some of the GIS tools available in R, the open-source programming language.</description>

      <title>Funding cuts and deprivation in England</title>

      <description>The most deprived parts of England have borne the brunt of public spending cuts since 2010. As spending now begins to increase, this could bring relief to some of the hardest-hit local councils. However, this analysis shows that the gains - unlike the cuts - will be shared fairly evenly among both affluent and deprived parts of England.
In 2010 the UK government embarked on a series of major spending cuts to reduce its budget deficit, in response to the financial crisis.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my new blog, which I’m using as an opportunity to explore new data analysis tools. This is intended as an exercise in learning-by-doing - as I learn new tools, I will be using them to explore real-life data sets.
Most of the analysis carried out in this blog will use the R programming language. I’m increasingly relying on this powerful and versatile tool to complement Microsoft Excel in my day to day analysis For anyone getting started in R, I highly recommend the excellent and accessible R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund.</description>
