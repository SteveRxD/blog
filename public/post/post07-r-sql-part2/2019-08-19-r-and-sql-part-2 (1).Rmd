# 1. Joins{#part1}

This section assumes a basic understanding of the different types of joins, specifically left join, inner join and full join. For those who are new to SQL, this section of [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html#understanding-joins), by Hadley Wickham, provides a nice explanation of the different types joins. 

#### 1.1 Inner join{#part1_1}

##### Example 1

Say we want to list the name of every employee from the _employees_ table who has one or more customers recorded in the _customers_ table. We want to see the following information:

- employee number
- employee first name
- employee second name
- customer name(s)

This is an example of an inner join, as we only want records that have a match in both tables. In this case, we want to match the _employeeNumber_ in in the _employees_ table with the _salesRepEmployeeNumber_ in the _customers_ table. 

_With SQL:_

```markdown
SELECT employees.employeeNumber, 
       employees.lastName, 
       employees.firstName, 
       customers.customerName
FROM   employees 
INNER JOIN customers 
  ON employees.employeeNumber = customers.salesRepEmployeeNumber
ORDER BY lastName, customerName
```
Note that we specify the table from which column is taken, for example using `employees.employeeNumber` rather than just `employeeNumber`. 


_With R:_

The same join could be carried out in R using the following code. In the `by` argument, we first list the column to match from the left hand table ('employeeNumber') followed by the corresponding column from the right hand table ('salesRepEmployeeNumber'). 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
employees %>%   #left hand table
  inner_join(customers, by = c("employeeNumber" = "salesRepEmployeeNumber")) %>%
  select(employeeNumber, lastName, firstName, customerName) %>% 
  arrange(lastName, customerName)
```

These two sets of code return 100 records:
```{r, echo = FALSE}
employees %>%   #left hand table
  inner_join(customers, by = c("employeeNumber" = "salesRepEmployeeNumber")) %>%
  select(employeeNumber, lastName, firstName, customerName) %>% 
  arrange(lastName, customerName) %>% 
  showTable()
```

##### Example 2

Say instead that we wanted to list every customer from the _customers_ table who has one or more orders in the _orders_ table. We want to see the following information:

- customer number
- customer name 
- order number
- current order status

This is another example of an inner join, this time matching records using the 'customerNumber' column which is the same in both tables. 

_With SQL:_

The fact that the same column name is used in both tables means we can simplify our code with `USING` in place of the `ON` expression that was used above:

```markdown
SELECT c.customerNumber, 
       c.customerName, 
       o.orderNumber, 
       o.status
FROM       customers AS c 
INNER JOIN orders AS o
  USING    (customerNumber)
ORDER BY   customerName
```
In the example above, we've also used [aliases](http://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-alias/) in place of the full table names, i.e. 'c' for 'customers' and 'o' for 'orders'. This is done with `AS` (though even this can be dropped). This makes the code shorter and easier to read. 

_With R:_

The equivalent R code is shown below. Note that we now only need to specify the one column name in the `by` argument.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
customers %>% 
  inner_join(orders, by = "customerNumber") %>%
  select(customerNumber, customerName, orderNumber, status) %>% 
  arrange(customerName)
```

This code returns 326 rows, the first 50 of which are shown below:
```{r, echo = FALSE}
customers %>% 
  inner_join(orders, by = c("customerNumber" = "customerNumber")) %>% 
  select(customerNumber, customerName, orderNumber, status) %>% 
  arrange(customerName) %>% 
  showTable(y = 50)
```

#### 1.2 Left join{#part1_2}

In the example above we were interested in the records of customers in the `customers` table which had a corresponding order in the `orders` table. But what if we wanted to see records of _all_ customers, even if they didn't have any associated orders? 

To do this we can use `LEFT JOIN` in SQL and `left_join()` in R, as follows:

_With SQL:_ 

```markdown
SELECT c.customerNumber, 
       c.customerName, 
       o.orderNumber, 
       o.status
FROM      customers AS c
LEFT JOIN orders AS o
  ON c.customerNumber = o.customerNumber
ORDER BY customerName
```

_With R:_ 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
customers %>% 
  left_join(orders, by = "customerNumber") %>% 
  select(customerNumber, customerName, orderNumber, status) %>% 
  arrange(customerName)
```

This returns 350 rows, including customers who do not have a corresponding order (such as 'American Souvenirs Inc') in which case the columns with order information will have NULL or NA values:
```{r, echo = FALSE}
customers %>% 
  left_join(orders, by = "customerNumber") %>% 
  select(customerNumber, customerName, orderNumber, status) %>% 
  arrange(customerName) %>% 
  showTable()
```
